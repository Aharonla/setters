# setters
the setters exercise from codecademy's Introduction to JavaScript course (Advanced objects lesson, exercise 6 - Setters)

there are 5 parts to this exercise:

1: Currently, in robot there is a getter method for numOfSensors but no setter method! What if we need to add or remove some sensors? Letâ€™s fix that problem.

Add a setter method named numOfSensors using the set keyword. Provide a parameter of num. Leave the function body empty for now.

2: There are a couple of things we should do in the setter method:

Add a check to see if num is a number using the typeof operator.
num should also be greater than or equal to 0.
If both conditions are met, reassign this._numOfSensors to num.

3: Now add an else that logs 'Pass in a number that is greater than or equal to 0' to the console.

4: Use the numOfSensors setter method on robot to assign _numOfSensors to 100.

5: To check that the setter method worked, console.log() robot.numOfSensors.


the lesson was completed successfully. 
the use of of setter methods was briefly practiced.
